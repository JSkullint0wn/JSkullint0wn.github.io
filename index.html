  <pre>
  Openbender project is not openjarvis, same opensource base products but core and app only html js css and php ...
  No contributions, no mails, no contacts, nothing ... no thanks ...
  Project web based for unity Arch x86 arm sparc etc ...
  
  This project is on a darkbian O.S it's like a raspberry but not the same color ...
  Embedded project on Pi Z + Meccano Alien droid modified + mushroom lidl for the blue touch and bluetooth sound 
  to control your droid with a pi or a smartphone or a win32,5 only vlc and web interface, play music or sound or conversation ... no driver for the embedded bluetooth mic, just to speak directly by the mushrum ... 
  Like to propulse a droid voyager in space with the infinite space, movment could be a battery's charger 
  to re launch if no more sound ...
  You can also record "Killing all humans" Bender love this idea ...
  Stick with Scotch Hack only ... I love the Scotch Powerfull ...

For a dark openjarvis srv-web plugin for developper technicall only (for the rest of people, it's only an error ...):
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get install php5 nodejs npm
  - npm install http-server -g
  - npm install socket-io-server
  
  and the following lines to launch powerfull servers instances js and php and server on 127.0.0.1 for app which interact 
  with the operating system:
  - nodejs /usr/local/bin/http-server -p 110 /home/pi/jarvis/"directory_files_name"
  - php5 -a -S 127.0.0.1:111 -t /home/pi/jarvis/"directory_files_name"
  
  and you can launch the jarvis-ui web interface with the same process:
  - nodejs /usr/local/bin/http-server -p 101 /home/pi/jarvis/plugins_installed/jarvis-ui/
  
  write it and chmod 755 for the file install.sh and execute it in a bash for an openjarvis plugin integration
